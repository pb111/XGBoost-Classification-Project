## 1. Introduction to XGBoost algorithm


**XGBoost** stands for **Extreme Gradient Boosting**.  XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is dominating the world of applied machine learning and Kaggle competitions. It is an implementation of gradient boosted trees designed for speed and accuracy.


XGBoost was developed by Tianqi Chen in C++ but also enables interfaces for Python, R and Julia. Initially, he started XGBoost as a research project as part of the Distributed (Deep) Machine Learning Community. It became popular in the ML competitions after its use in the winning solution of the Higgs Machine Learning Challenge.
